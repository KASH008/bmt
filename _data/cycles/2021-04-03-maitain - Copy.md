#  How to Keep Your BMW Running Like New?
We use our cars for everything from running errands to getting to work. For most of us, it's essential to life and livelihood.
For BMW owners, this fact is even more emphasized—a BMW is not only a vital appendage, but a treasure, something to be proud of. That’s why few things are more frustrating than encountering some form of car trouble—especially if it’s getting in the way of getting where you have to go. BMW repair takes up valuable time, money, and energy. Fortunately, many of the most common types of BMW issues can be avoided—with proper check-ins and maintenance. 
#  Importance of Car Maintenance
Routine BMW maintenance is a hard one to get into. Most people put off auto maintenance because it’s inconvenient, time-consuming and somehow budget intensive.
Whether you’re on a tight budget and tempted to skip your routine maintenance, or your schedule compels you to delay an appointment with your auto shop, know this: poor car maintenance can have dastardly consequences. For these German machines there is no shortcut .skipping maintenance or doing it on the cheap can take years off your car’s life span. Say, for example, that an average vehicle could drive roughly 200,000 miles over its lifetime. Without proper care, you’re knocking that drive time down to 150,000 miles or less. In short, you’re (unnecessarily) losing 25% of your car’s durability.
