### Cons 
If you don’t take care of it it will break, like everything else. Make friends with the local independent BMW shop and fix each problem as it arises. Do NOT defer maintenance. If you let things pile up, it will be a nightmare or to expensive to fix all at once.

A 3-series from 2000–2006 is inexpensive and the parts are getting a lot cheaper. There a lot of these cars still on the road and the aftermarket folks are now making most parts for them.

In the long run, I find maintenance to be way less expensive than car payments. In other words keep the car and pay it off. Then it’s cheap. Before, I was buying a different used car every 2–3 years because of a major problem. We’ve owed the X5 since 2005 with <30k miles. After 200k additional miles it looks and drives like a car about 4 years old.

Make sure you use PREMIUM GAS all the time. Do NOT let some tell you there is no difference. I find a lot of people with engine problems are the types trying to save 2 to 4$ per tank by using a fuel the car is NOT designed to take. Think or the extra 2–4$ as ongoing maintenance.
