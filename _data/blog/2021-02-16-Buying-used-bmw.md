# What's the best way to purchase a used BMW?
Well, I get this question often,and the answer has been the same .You are your own judge. But first, there are a few pointers one should consider when buying a used car.
###  How long the car has been in use.
**How long has the car been used?** is the first point to consider. The german machines are heavily engineered and owners are expected to follow the manual strictly. It's paramount to be able to trace how optimally the car was maintained if you are buying from a private seller.
 
###  Average annual maintenance cost.
