# Most Important Service Items
It’s inevitable that you’ll have to bring your automobile into the shop at some point. However, by bringing in your BMW vehicle for regular BMW repair by a professional, you can avoid costly emergency services later. You’ll also keep your car running faster, better, and longer than it otherwise would.
###  Engine—First things first: 
Your car’s engine is the heart of the car; what it keeps it going. With any sort of engine problems, you face a risk of danger, your car is not functioning at its optimal level, or your car is rendered useless. I.e. even small engine issues can equal BIG problems. Have your engine checked a few times a year. At the same time, have your transmission checked. Otherwise, you may find yourself stuck on a busy road this summer, sweltering under the Austin sun.
###  Brakes
While your BMW’s engine is necessary to keep going, your BMW’s brakes are essential to stopping. Checking your brakes should be a part of your regular basic car maintenance. Healthy brakes are key to good safety. Here’s where the assistance of a good, professional mechanic is extra important. Our resident BMW repair expert recommends flushing the brake system every two years or so.
This is because brake fluid is hydroscopic and will absorb moisture from the air. Over time, this absorption dangerously contaminates the brake fluid, eventually causing brake system failures. Another thing to have your LAW mechanic look at at the same time are your brake pads. Dirty brake pads can cause annoying squeaking and other.
###  Tires
Tires play an important role in your vehicle. Not only do they physically get you where you need to go, but they are key to keeping you safe and to maximizing your fuel economy. In fact, faulty or damaged tires are one of the top sources of car accidents in the U.S.
Even just a slight tire problem can turn into a big issue. In a study, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) found that tires under inflated by more than 25 percent are three times as likely to be involved in an accident. Tires should always be properly inflated; air should be put in as often as needed. Check your tire pressure at least once a month, or ideally once a week. Remember that you can pick up a puncture at any time and you may not even be aware of it unless you are regularly checking your tires.
Additionally, your tires must be rotated every so often. Rotating tires means moving them from one side of the car to the other. This is done because tires tend to wear unevenly—front tires tend to wear on the outside edges whereas the rear wheels, which simply follow the front, wear down more evenly. However, if you don’t rotate your tires, your front tires will wear down much faster than the rest, eventually forcing you to replace them thousands of miles sooner than you otherwise might have to. We recommend bringing in your BMW for a tire rotation at least every 6 months, or every 3000 to 6000 miles.
###  Cooling system
The cooling system is an extremely important part of your BMW. The primary function of the cooling system is to cool down the engine and maintain an ideal operating temperature. In order to prevent an overheated car, you should flush your system with engine coolant, which has lubrication properties that keep the water pump, thermostat, and other internal components from seizing. Your cooling system should be flushed every 3 years.
###  Transmission
The BMW dealer will tell you that their transmission fluid is a lifetime fill. This allows BMW to make money selling new transmission assemblies when the transmission starts slipping gears around 70-90K miles. However, we recommend flushing the transmission every 50K miles instead. It’s much more efficient to regularly service the transmission fluid and filter than to pay the cost of replacing a transmission. Similarly, flush the transfer case, front differential, and rear differential every 50K miles. You’ll be paying about 1/20th the cost this way.
### Steering system
Your steering system affects your ability to control your BMW vehicle, making it an essential component of your safety. To keep your steering system in good shape, we recommend flushing the power steering fluid system once every 50K miles. Power steering fluid breaks down over time and the fluid becomes contaminated. This can cause steering system leaks and other failures.
###  Oil
Regularly changing your oil is one of the most important things you can do for your car’s health. It can potentially save you from shelling out thousands to an auto shop later on. The BMW Owner Manual recommends changing oil every 12,000 to 15,000 miles. However, this results in carbon build up in your car’s intake valves, which can lead to serious problems.
We recommend changing oil every 5000 miles to help prevent this. 5000 miles may seem too soon, but 5000-mile oil changes will help bring your BMW vehicles to a ripe old age. Plus, cars driving in hot climates like Austin need their oil changed more frequently. Thankfully, if this is something you don’t want to pay for, oil changes are something you can do relatively easily by yourself. Also, don’t forget your oil filters! These need changing on a regular basis.
